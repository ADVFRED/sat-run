I was assigned a project to make an activity to reveiw a set of voabulary words for my english class and thought that MakeCode Arcade would be an easy platform to through something together. About that. Its a fine platform (most of the time) and when you hit a roadblock theres very helpful people on the forum who graciously help out! Its a bit bare bones as far as games go but I think it'll blow all the word searches out of the water :D

Huge thank you to [@ricknoll](https://github.com/riknoll) for pointing out what should have been obvious and getting me back on track
